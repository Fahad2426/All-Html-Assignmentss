    <p>Chicken Biryani is a savory chicken and rice dish that includes layers of <br> chicken, rice, and aromatics that are steamed together. The bottom layer <br> of rice absorbs all the chicken juices as it cooks, giving it a tender texture <br> and rich flavor, while the top layer of rice turns out white and fluffy.</p>
