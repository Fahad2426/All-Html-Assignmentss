    <p>Malai Boti aka Malai Tikka are melt-in-the-mouth chunks of boneless chicken <br> marinated in a mildly flavoured cream sauce made with fresh herbs. <br> The chicken is so succulent and perfect to enjoy with a green chutney <br> as an appetizer or put into parathas or wraps for a full meal.</p>
