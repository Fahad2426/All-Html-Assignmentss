    <p>Dhaga Kabab is a type of a Seekh Kabab but it is super soft and melt in the mouth. <br> The main feature of this dish is that it is tied down with a thread. Since the <br> mince is soft the thread helps to hold it and prevents it from falling <br> apart. When you remove the thread some of the Kababs might fall apart but that is fine.</p>
